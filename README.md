# So, you're a casual jeanser.

You've probably just discovered your love for jeans. 
You're thinking, "What should I do next?" "Where should I go?" "Is there anybody else like me?"

Well, jeans.nonbinary is the definitive answer to all those questions. We will endeavour to provide layman's reviews and recommendations on jeans. Other jeans review accounts might advertise themselves by using fancy words. But we don't. Why? Because we understand that the average jeanser is not here for *Vouge* or *Runway* level advice. They're only here to ask three questions:

* Are these jeans stylish?
* Are these jeans comfortable?
* **Are these jeans good?**

Coincidentally, these three questions comprise the core of our publishing process. Get the answers by the end of every post, or your money back!
